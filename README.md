# Weather App

This app provides an easy and hassle-free way to get the forecast of a specific city in no time.

**User Guide**:
- On start the app will detect the user's location and display the forecast for 3 days accordingly
- The user can display the forecast for a specific place using search input field

**If the forecasts load endlessly on app start one workaround is to disable adblockers or use the search input field.**

**_This is caused by a conflict between the geolocation api and adblockers_**
